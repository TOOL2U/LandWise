PORTFOLIO SLIDESHOW IMAGE UPDATE INSTRUCTIONS

To complete the portfolio slideshow setup, you need to manually save these two images:

1. DRAINAGE FLOW ANALYSIS IMAGE:
   - Save the first attachment (drainage flow analysis image) as:
   - /Users/shaunducker/Desktop/LandWise/public/assets/portfolio/drainage_flow_analysis.png
   - This replaces the placeholder file that was created

2. SITE ANALYSIS SURVEY IMAGE:
   - Save the second attachment (site analysis survey image) as:
   - /Users/shaunducker/Desktop/LandWise/public/assets/portfolio/site_analysis_survey.png
   - This replaces the placeholder file that was created

These images are already configured in the slideshow and will appear automatically once you save the actual image files.
