PORTFOLIO SLIDESHOW STATUS UPDATE

✅ DRAINAGE FLOW ANALYSIS - FIXED!
The drainage flow analysis image is now working properly.

ISSUE RESOLVED:
- The original file "\drainage canva.png" had a problematic backslash in the filename
- Renamed to "drainage_flow_analysis.png" (2MB file size - confirmed working)
- No more image loading errors

🔄 STILL NEEDS MANUAL UPDATE:
- site_analysis_survey.png is still a placeholder (122 bytes)
- You need to manually save the second attachment as this file

CURRENT SLIDESHOW STATUS:
✅ Working: 13 out of 14 images
⏳ Placeholder: 1 image (site_analysis_survey.png)

TO COMPLETE SETUP:
Save the second attachment (site location & land context analysis) as:
/Users/shaunducker/Desktop/LandWise/public/assets/portfolio/site_analysis_survey.png
